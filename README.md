# PlugDrive Frontend Tasks

> NOTE: This is a temporary space for our tasks. Do not comment on the isssues. If you have any questions, leave it in the `#development` channel on PlugDrive Slack.

Repository â€” https://bitbucket.org/sourcertz/ev-frontend-v2/src/develop

For every issue, branch off the `develop` branch and open a pull request from your source branch into `develop`. Add **Gyen** as reviewer. Ensure your PR only contains changes that resolve the issue you're working on so it's easy to review.

Work on issues that have your `[name]` in the title. For example, Frank would work on [this issue](https://github.com/gyenabubakar/plugdrive-tasks/issues/2).

Use [shadcn-vue components](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/accordion.html) unless a component you want to use does not exist. If you need to develop your own component, for consistency, ensure that it looks and feels like shadcn-vue components.

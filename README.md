# PlugDrive Frontend Tasks

For every issue, branch off the `develop` branch and open a pull request from your source branch into `develop`. Add **Gyen** as reviewer. Ensure your PR only contains changes that resolve the issue you're working on so it's easy to review.

Work on issues that have your `[name]` in the title. For example, Frank would work on [this issue](https://github.com/gyenabubakar/plugdrive-tasks/issues/2).
